# Critically Fumbled

This is a Foundry VTT module for Dungeons & Dragons 5e that makes your games a bit more interesting (and sometimes chaotic) by adding consequences for rolling natural 1s or max results on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.
By default, it checks attack rolls for natural 1s or max results. You can enable options in the settings to also check manual rolls (like 1d2, 1d4, etc.), saving throws, and ability checks.

## What Does It Do?

Whenever someone makes a qualifying roll (attack by default, or others if enabled), the module checks for a natural 1 or the highest possible result. If triggered, it pulls a result from a rollable table you set up in Foundry.

## How It Works

- **Checks attack rolls by default** for natural 1s and max results. You can enable checks for manual rolls, saving throws, and ability checks in the settings.
- **Detects natural 1s and max rolls** (like a 20 on a d20 or the highest result on any die).
- **Triggers a rollable table** (of your choice) when these results happen—just copy the UUID of your rollable table and paste it into the module settings.

## Setup

1. **Install the module** in Foundry VTT.
2. **Create a rollable table** with the effects or consequences you want.
3. **Copy the UUID** of your table (right-click the table in Foundry, select "Copy UUID").
4. **Paste the UUID** into the module's settings.
5. That's it! Now, whenever someone rolls a 1 or the max on a d20, the module will pull a result from your table.

## Why Use This?

- Add flavor and unpredictability to your D&D 5e games.
- Make critical failures and successes more memorable.
- Fully customizable—use any table you want.

## Example Use Cases

- Fumble tables for weapon mishaps.
- Wild magic surges on spellcasting.
- Critical success boons.
