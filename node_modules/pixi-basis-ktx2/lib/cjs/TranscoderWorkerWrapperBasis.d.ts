/**
 * This wraps the transcoder web-worker functionality; it can be converted into a string to get the source code. It expects
 * you to prepend the transcoder JavaScript code so that the `BASIS` namespace is available.
 *
 * The transcoder worker responds to two types of messages: "init" and "transcode". You must always send the first "init"
 * {@link IInitializeTranscoderMessage} message with the WebAssembly binary; if the transcoder is successfully initialized,
 * the web-worker will respond by sending another {@link ITranscodeResponse} message with `success: true`.
 * @ignore
