## Supported Foundry VTT versions

We aim to support the latest release of each Foundry VTT version (0.7, 0.8, 9, etc.), starting with 0.7.

At the moment, versions 0.7, 0.8, and 9 are fully supported with partial support for versions 10, 11, and 12. Work on support for version 13 is currently underway.

## AI

AI cannot be provided the source of Foundry VTT Types. This is because Foundry VTT Types contains documentation from Foundry and AI is _**not**_ allowed to be used on the source of Foundry due to its [End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://foundryvtt.com/article/license/). Staff members have confirmed there is no exception for AI.

## V13 Installation

Currently v13 is still in beta. There are known bugs, issues in the ergonomics, and unfinished work in the current implementation. To get a direct line of communication about the current status of development as well as to help us understand what areas need to be prioritized first, join the [League of Extraordinary FoundryVTT Developers Discord](https://discord.gg/73HTMuK7dT) or file an issue.

The recommended way to install for v13 is this command:

```sh
npm add -D fvtt-types@github:League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-vtt-types#main
```

The command for other package managers is similar, for example with yarn you'll need to use the command `yarn add --dev fvtt-types@github:League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-vtt-types#main`.

This will add the current commit on `main` as a dependency. Every popular package manager has a lockfile which will store the commit you initially installed this command and so updates to your dependency will not happen automatically or even after a fresh install. To update you will need to be rerun the prior command periodically to update as improvements are added frequently.

## Installation

You can install historical versions of foundry-vtt-types from the [npm registry](https://npmjs.org/).

In order to install the latest stable version, run

```sh
npm add --save-dev fvtt-types@npm:@league-of-foundry-developers/foundry-vtt-types
```

In order to install a specific version run

```sh
npm add --save-dev fvtt-types@npm:@league-of-foundry-developers/foundry-vtt-types@<version>
```

For example, to install version `9.268.0`, run

```sh
npm add --save-dev fvtt-types@npm:@league-of-foundry-developers/foundry-vtt-types@9.268.0
```

You can then update foundry-vtt-types using the regular update mechanism for npm
(see [npm update](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-update)).

## Versioning scheme

The versions of the foundry-vtt-types correspond to the releases of Foundry VTT. The versioning scheme of Foundry VTT
changed with version 9, so the versioning scheme for the foundry-vtt-types also changes with that version:

- For Foundry VTT version 0.7 and 0.8, the versioning scheme is

  ```text
  0.<foundy-minor-version>.<foundry-patch-version>-<increment>
  ```

- For Foundry VTT version 9 and onwards, the versioning scheme is

  ```text
  <foundry-version>.<foundry-build>.<increment>
  ```

  In both cases, `increment` is a number that increases with every individual release of the foundry-vtt-types for that
  Foundry VTT release.

## Usage

Add foundry-vtt-types to your types section in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["fvtt-types"],
    "target": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

Compiler Option Notes:

- `types` is set to make fvtt-types globally available in your project. Without it global variables like `game` and `CONFIG` won't appear.
- `"target": "esnext"` is recommended because Foundry lives on the bleeding edge of JavaScript features. If you want to downlevel your code setting `"lib": ["esnext", "dom"]` and `target` is reasonable but TypeScript's downlevelling is not the most advanced and so it's probably a good idea to leave this to other tools. It's a bad idea to lower the `lib` version as Foundry will frequently use new JavaScript features. Nevertheless the minimum out of the box usable lib is `es2022` as before that types like `WeakRef` won't exist.
- Using `"strict": true` is _highly_ recommended because it enables a whole host of useful options. However if you want to check that your config supports foundry-vtt-types, the most important settings under `strict` would be `strictNullChecks` and `strictFunctionTypes`.
- Changing the `moduleResolution` is generally not recommended. Only new `moduleResolution` strategies have support for certain imports like `"fvtt-types/utils"`. For example the Node `moduleResolutions` above `node16` may work but have additional Node-only constraints not relevant to the browser.

You can find some information about how to actually work with the type definitions in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-vtt-types/wiki). A good starting point is
the [FAQ](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-vtt-types/wiki/FAQ).

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome in order to decrease the individual workload. Filing issues for wrong / missing types is
also a great way to help us improve the type definitions.

Development on the current version of Foundry VTT is done on the `main` branch. Additionally, we keep branches for the
older version of Foundry VTT that we still support. These branches are named according to the Foundry VTT version they
correspond to. For example, the branch for Foundry VTT 0.8 is called `foundry-0.8.x`. All work to improve the type
definitions needs to be done through Pull Requests to the relevant branch.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how to contribute.
